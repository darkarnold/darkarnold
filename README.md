## Hi, I'm Arnold ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a focus on hybrid mobile development using React Native. I have been working with this technology for the past 2 years and have gained valuable experience in creating cross-platform mobile applications.

Here's a little bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on honing my skills in hybrid mobile development with React Native.
- ðŸŒ± I'm continuously learning and exploring the latest trends and best practices in web development.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on any project that can help me further enhance my skills and knowledge.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about anything related to hybrid mobile development, React Native, or even topics like Anime, Manga, and comic book TV shows. I'm a big fan!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Twitter [@NinjaVader](https://www.twitter.com/NinjaVader).
- âš¡ Fun fact: Besides being a software developer, I'm also an avid anime watcher and love to dive into various TV shows.

Let's connect and create amazing things together! ðŸ˜„
